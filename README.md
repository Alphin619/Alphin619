###  Aspiring SOC Analyst | Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Blue Team Focus

Motivated cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in SIEM monitoring, threat detection, log analysis, and incident response. I focus on solving security problems and understanding how attacks unfold from both defensive and offensive perspectives.

## Objective

My journey in Information Security Analyst has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst.
